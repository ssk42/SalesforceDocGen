# Changelog

## v2.7.0.4 — "Beacon"
- **Proactive Heap Estimator** — The Bulk Runner now automatically estimates the final heap usage before you start a merge job. It simulates a single document generation and projects the total memory requirement, warning you if the job is likely to exceed the 12MB limit.
- **Word Header/Footer Support for PDF** — Content in Word headers and footers (like company addresses and logos) is now correctly included when generating PDFs.
- **Fixed Run Data Loss** — Resolved an issue where text or merge tags in a Docx run were lost if the run also contained a line break (`<w:br/>`).
- **Query Sanitization Graceful Failure** — Invalid clauses in query configurations no longer fail the entire generation.
- **Improved Parent Object Detection** — Fixed self-referential lookup detection.

## v2.6.0 — "Apollo+"
- **Bulk Data Pre-Cache** — All record data queried in a single SOQL with an IN clause during batch `start()`, cached as a JSON ContentVersion on the Job record. Each `execute()` reads from cache instead of re-querying. Eliminates 500+ individual SOQL queries for V3 configs. Graceful fallback to per-record queries for V1/V2 or if cache exceeds 4MB.
- **Template Static Cache** — Template metadata, file content, and pre-decomposed XML parts are cached statically across batch executions. First record queries the template; remaining records reuse it. Zero redundant template SOQL.
- **Merge PDFs Mode** — New "Merge PDFs" checkbox in bulk runner. Generates individual PDFs per record AND produces a single merged PDF at the end. HTML captured as a byproduct of `renderPdf()` — zero extra processing per record.
- **Merge Only Mode** — New "Merge Only" checkbox. Skips `Blob.toPdf()` and ContentVersion saves per record entirely. Only generates HTML snippets, assembles once in a Queueable, renders one merged PDF. ~5-8x faster than individual PDF generation for large batches.
- **Server-Side PDF Assembly** — `DocGenMergeJob` Queueable reads HTML snippets by title prefix, concatenates with page breaks, calls `Blob.toPdf()` once, saves merged PDF linked to the Job record. Accessible anytime via `Merged_PDF_CV__c`.
- **Custom Notifications** — Bell icon + Salesforce mobile push notification on all bulk job completions. Merge jobs notify with page count; normal jobs notify with success/fail count. Tapping navigates to the Job record. Uses `DocGen_Job_Complete` custom notification type.
- **Configurable Batch Size** — New "Batch Size" input in bulk runner UI (1-200, default 1). Simple text-only templates can use 10-50 for faster throughput. Complex templates with images stay at 1 for max heap.
- **lookupField Bug Fix** — Query tree builder now uses the actual lookup field API name from schema describe (`opt.lookupField`) instead of guessing from the parent object name. Fixes incorrect SOQL for custom objects where the lookup field name doesn't match the object name (e.g., `abc__Purchase_Order__c` vs `abc__PurchaseOrder__c`).
- **DateTime Filter Fix** — `getObjectFields()` now returns field type metadata. Filter builder appends `T00:00:00Z` to date-only values on datetime fields. Report filter import applies the same fix for standard datetime fields like CreatedDate.
- **Image Deduplication Confirmed** — Tested `Blob.toPdf()` image handling: same image URL repeated across pages is stored once in the PDF (confirmed via size analysis). Template logos on 500 pages = one embedded image, not 500.
- **New Custom Objects/Fields** — `Data_Cache_CV__c` (bulk data cache), `Merged_PDF_CV__c` (merged PDF link), `Merge_Only__c` (merge-only flag) on DocGen_Job__c. "Merging" status added to Status picklist. `DocGen_Job_Complete` custom notification type.
- **New Apex Classes** — `DocGenMergeJob` (Queueable for server-side PDF assembly).
- **E2E Tests** — 19/19 passing. No regressions from bulk caching or merge changes.

## v2.5.0 — "Apollo+"
- **Child Record PDF Merge** — New "Child Record PDFs" mode in the document generator. Pick a child relationship (e.g., Opportunities from Account), optionally filter with a WHERE clause, browse PDFs attached to each child record with grouped checkboxes and Select All, merge selected PDFs into one document. Download or save to parent record.
- **Bulk Generate + Merge** — After a bulk PDF job completes, merge all generated PDFs into a single downloadable document. Merge icon button on each completed job in the Recent Jobs list for easy access later.
- **Named Bulk Jobs** — Give bulk jobs a custom name (e.g., "March Receipts") for easy identification. Search bar filters the Recent Jobs list by name, template, or status.
- **Aggregate Format Specifiers** — Aggregate tags now support format suffixes: `{SUM:LineItems.TotalPrice:currency}` → $55,000.00. Works with `:currency`, `:percent`, `:number`, and custom patterns like `:#,##0.00`.
- **Aggregate Bug Fix** — Fixed silent failure when format specifiers (`:currency`, etc.) were appended to aggregate tags. The format suffix was being included in the field name lookup, causing the tag to resolve to "0" or disappear.
- **VF Fallback Removed** — Removed `DocGenPdfRenderer` VF page and `DocGenPdfRendererController`. `Blob.toPdf()` with the Spring '26 Release Update handles all PDF rendering. Eliminates the last security scan violation and reduces attack surface.
- **Security Hardening** — Zero PMD security violations. All 22 findings resolved: SOQL injection (validated inputs + NOPMD), CRUD (package-internal objects with permission sets), XSS (ID validation + escaping).
- **Page Breaks in Loops** — README now documents how to use Word page breaks inside child loops for one-page-per-record output (receipts, invoices, certificates).
- **E2E Test Coverage** — 6 new aggregate tests (T14-T19): COUNT, SUM, SUM:currency, AVG, MIN, MAX. Total: 19 tests.

## v2.4.0 — "Apollo+"
- **QR Codes** — `{*Field:qr}` generates QR codes in PDF output. Supports up to 255 characters (full text field). Custom sizing: `{*Field:qr:200}` for 200px square. Version 1-14 with Level M error correction and Reed-Solomon.
- **Barcode Sizing** — `{*Field:code128:300x80}` for custom barcode dimensions.
- **Number & Currency Formatting** — `{Amount:currency}` → $500,000.00. Also `:percent`, `:number`, and custom patterns like `{Price:#,##0.00}`.
- All 13 barcode/QR tests passing, E2E 13/13.

## v2.3.0 — "Apollo+"
- **PDF Merger** — Generate a document and merge it with existing PDFs on the record in one step. Client-side merge engine (`docGenPdfMerger.js`) — pure JS, no external dependencies, zero heap.
- **Merge-Only Mode** — Combine existing PDFs without generating a template. Dual-listbox for reordering. Select 2+ PDFs, merge, download or save.
- **Document Packets** — Select multiple PDF templates, generate each for the same record, merge into one combined document. Optionally append existing PDFs.
- **Aggregate Tags** — `{SUM:QuoteLineItems.TotalPrice}`, `{COUNT:Contacts}`, `{AVG:...}`, `{MIN:...}`, `{MAX:...}`. Computed from child record data already in memory — zero extra SOQL.
- **Barcode Tags** — `{*FieldName}` renders Code 128 barcodes as CSS bars in PDF output. No images, no fonts — pure HTML/CSS rendered by `Blob.toPdf()`.
- **Excel (XLSX) Output** — Upload an Excel template with merge tags in cells. Engine parses shared strings table, inlines references, merges tags, and assembles via client-side ZIP. Same pattern as DOCX.
- **Save to Record for All Formats** — DOCX, XLSX, and PDF can all be saved back to the record. Previously PDF-only.
- **Query Builder Fix** — Selecting fields, changing the search filter, and selecting more fields no longer loses previous selections. Hidden selections are preserved across filter changes.
- **Show Selected Toggle** — New button in the query builder to filter the field list to only selected fields. Works alongside search.
- **Robust PDF Parsing** — Root catalog detection follows `startxref` spec path with nested `<<>>` dictionary handling. Works with PDF 1.5+ cross-reference streams.
- **Page Ordering Fix** — Merged PDFs preserve correct reading order from each document's page tree.

## v2.0.0 — "Apollo"
- **Single-App Experience** — One tab, three cards: Templates, Bulk Generate, How It Works. No more tab sprawl.
- **Bulk Runner Overhaul** — Typeahead template search, inline sample record picker, real PDF preview download, server-loaded job history. All in one view.
- **Zero-Heap PDF Preview** — `generatePdfBlob()` now forces PDF output format, ensuring the pre-decomposed path and relative image URLs are always used. Preview works on templates with dozens of images without hitting heap limits.
- **Query Builder Stability** — Fixed infinite re-parse loop that reset the active tab and wiped field selections on every checkbox toggle. V1 flat configs and V2 JSON configs now load correctly in the visual builder (backward compatible).
- **Self-Contained E2E Tests** — `scripts/e2e-test.apex` creates its own template, DOCX file, template version, test data, generates a real PDF, validates 13 assertions, and cleans up. Zero dependencies on pre-existing org data.
- **Report Filter Auto-Save** — Imported report WHERE clauses automatically saved as bulk queries and loaded when the template is selected.
- **Saved Query Management** — Save, load, and delete named SOQL conditions per template.
- **Recent Jobs Panel** — Completed bulk jobs load from the server with status, counts, template name, and date. Refreshes automatically when a job finishes.

## v1.6.0
- **Multi-Object Query Builder** — Tab-per-object layout with visual relationship tree. Build templates spanning Account → Opportunities → Line Items → Contacts in one view. Each object gets its own tab with field selection, parent field picker, and WHERE/ORDER BY/LIMIT.
- **V3 Query Tree Engine** — New JSON v3 config format. One SOQL query per object node, stitched together in Apex. Supports any depth with zero SOQL nesting limits. Backward compatible with v1/v2 configs.
- **Report Import** — Import field selections from ANY Salesforce Report. Dynamic base object resolution using plural label matching — works for standard, cross-object, and custom report types. Auto-detects parent lookups, child relationships, and junction objects. Report date filters extracted as bulk WHERE clauses.
- **Junction Object Support** — Contact via OpportunityContactRole, Campaign Members, and other junction objects detected and handled automatically. Two-hop queries stitch junction targets into the data map.
- **Click-to-Copy Merge Tags** — Click any tag in the builder to copy it to clipboard with a toast confirmation.
- **Bulk Runner Refresh** — Refresh button on template picker. Report filters auto-populate the WHERE clause when selecting a template built from a report import.
- **Backward-Compatible Upgrade** — Stub methods for removed signature classes allow v1.6.0 to install cleanly over v1.4.0 orgs.
- **E2E Test Suite** — `scripts/e2e-test.apex` validates 13 tests: V3 tree walker, parent fields, grandchild stitching, image CV creation, junction stitching, legacy backward compat, document generation. Self-cleaning. One click.
- **Stress Test** — `scripts/stress-test-data.apex` creates a Quote with 15 products, each with a product image. Validates zero-heap image rendering at scale.
- **Amanda-Friendly Naming** — All labels use plain English: "Opportunity Products" not "OpportunityLineItems", "Your Document Structure" not "Relationship Map", "Include parent fields" not "Add parent above".

## v1.5.0
- **Command Hub** — Single-tab UX replacing 7 tabs. Wizard-first onboarding, embedded bulk generator, contextual help.
- **Deep Grandchild Relationships** — Multi-level query stitching: Account → Opportunities → Line Items → Schedules. One SOQL per level, stitched in Apex. Query builder UI supports "Add Related List" inside child cards.
- **Signature Feature Removed** — E-signatures carry legal requirements a doc gen tool should not implement. Use dedicated providers (DocuSign, Adobe Sign).
- **Custom Font Upload Removed** — `Blob.toPdf()` does not support CSS `@font-face` (confirmed via data URIs, static resources, and ContentVersion URLs). PDF supports Helvetica, Times, Courier, Arial Unicode MS. DOCX preserves template fonts.
- **Font Documentation** — PDF font limitations documented. DOCX recommended for custom fonts.
- **DOCX Download Only** — Save to Record removed for DOCX output (Aura 4MB payload limit). Download works for any size.

## v1.3.4
- **Zero-Heap PDF Images** — `{%ImageField}` tags skip blob loading for PDF; images resolved by URL with zero heap cost
- **Pre-Decomposed Templates** — Template XML stored as ContentVersions on save; PDF generation skips ZIP decompression (~75% heap reduction)
