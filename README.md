## Install

**New install:**

```bash
sf package install --package 04tal000006PcppAAC --wait 10 --target-org <your-org>
```

[Install in Production](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tal000006PcppAAC) | [Install in Sandbox](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tal000006PcppAAC)

**Then:** Assign **DocGen Admin** permission set | Enable **Blob.toPdf() Release Update** | Open the **DocGen** app

### Upgrading from the old unnamespaced package

If you previously installed the unnamespaced "Document Generation" package:

1. **Uninstall** the old package (Setup > Installed Packages > Document Generation > Uninstall)
2. **Install** the new namespaced package using the links above
3. Re-assign the **DocGen Admin** or **DocGen User** permission sets
4. Re-create your templates (the old templates used different custom object API names without namespace)

> **Why the change?** The package now uses the `portwoodglobal` namespace for better isolation, upgrade safety, and Salesforce Accelerator distribution. This is a one-time migration.

## Giant Query PDF

Generate PDFs from records with **3,000 to 50,000+ child records** — entirely server-side, no external dependencies.

| | Standard Engine | Giant Query Engine |
|---|---|---|
| **When** | < 2,000 child records | > 2,000 child records |
| **Detection** | Automatic | Automatic |
| **PDF** | Instant render via `Blob.toPdf()` | Batch → Queueable chain → `Blob.toPdf()` |
| **DOCX** | Server-side ZIP or client-side assembly | Client-side pagination + assembly |
| **Speed** | ~2-5 seconds | ~1-5 minutes (async) |
| **Output** | Download or save to record | Saved to record automatically |

The engine auto-detects large datasets when you click Generate. Same template, same button — the complexity is invisible. Ideal for transaction logs, price books, audit trails, and bulk data reports.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Create a template** — pick Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. Choose your Salesforce object.
2. **Select your fields** — use the visual query builder to pick fields, parent lookups, and child records.
3. **Add tags and upload** — type `{Name}` where you want data. Upload the file.
4. **Generate** — from any record page, in bulk, or from a Flow.

---

## Merge Tags

| Tag | What It Does | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `{FieldName}` | Insert a field value | `{Name}`, `{Email}`, `{Phone}` |
| `{Parent.Field}` | Pull from a related record | `{Account.Name}`, `{Owner.Email}` |
| `{#ChildList}...{/ChildList}` | Repeat for each child record | `{#Contacts}{FirstName}{/Contacts}` |
| `{#BoolField}...{/BoolField}` | Show/hide based on field value | `{#IsActive}Active member{/IsActive}` |
| `{RichTextField}` | Rich text with formatting and images | `{Description}` on a Rich Text Area |

### Formatting

| Tag | Output | Works In |
|-----|--------|----------|
| `{CloseDate:MM/dd/yyyy}` | 03/18/2026 | All formats |
| `{Amount:currency}` | $500,000.00 | All formats |
| `{Rate:percent}` | 15.5% | All formats |
| `{Quantity:number}` | 1,234 | All formats |
| `{Price:#,##0.00}` | 1,234.56 | All formats |

### Aggregates

Place these **outside** the loop to compute totals from child records:

| Tag | Example |
|-----|---------|
| `{SUM:List.Field}` | `{SUM:QuoteLineItems.TotalPrice}` |
| `{COUNT:List}` | `{COUNT:Contacts}` |
| `{AVG:List.Field}` | `{AVG:OpportunityLineItems.UnitPrice}` |
| `{MIN:List.Field}` / `{MAX:List.Field}` | `{MIN:QuoteLineItems.Quantity}` |

Zero extra SOQL — computed from child data already in memory.

### Barcodes & QR Codes

Rendered as CSS in PDF output. No fonts, no images, no external services.

| Tag | What You Get |
|-----|-------------|
| `{*ProductCode}` | Code 128 barcode |
| `{*ProductCode:code128:300x80}` | Barcode at 300px wide, 80px tall |
| `{*Website:qr}` | QR code at 150px (default) |
| `{*TrackingUrl:qr:200}` | QR code at 200px square |

QR codes support up to **255 characters** — enough for a full Salesforce text field or URL.

### Images

| Tag | What It Does |
|-----|-------------|
| `{%Logo__c}` | Insert image at original size (from image metadata when available) |
| `{%Logo__c:200x60}` | Fixed size: width 200px, height 60px |
| `{%Logo__c:100%x}` | Fixed width: 100% of page content width, keep aspect ratio |
| `{%Logo__c:x50%}` | Fixed height: 50% of page content height, keep aspect ratio |
| `{%Logo__c:m100%x}` | Max width: shrink to fit page width, never upscale |
| `{%Logo__c:xm50%}` | Max height: shrink to 50% page height, never upscale |
| `{%Logo__c:m100%xm50%}` | Max width + max height constraints (shrink-to-fit) |

Store a ContentVersion ID (starts with `068`) in a text field. Works in Word templates — PDF and DOCX output.

Image size syntax is `:widthxheight` with optional tokens:

- `300` or `300px` = pixels
- `100%` = percentage of current page content area
- `m` prefix = max constraint (shrink only, CSS-style max behavior)
- blank side is allowed: `100%x`, `x100%`, `m100%x`, `xm50%`

### Rich Text Fields

Rich text fields (`{Description}`, `{Notes__c}`) render with full formatting (bold, italic, lists) in both PDF and DOCX output.

**Images in rich text fields:**

| Output | Rich Text Images | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **PDF** | :white_check_mark: Works | `Blob.toPdf()` resolves Salesforce image URLs natively |
| **DOCX** | :x: Not supported | Salesforce `rtaImage` servlet URLs are inaccessible server-side (CORS + redirect restrictions). Use `{%FieldName}` image tags instead |

**Recommendation:** For documents that need images in DOCX format, upload the image as a Salesforce File, store the ContentVersion ID in a text field, and use `{%FieldName}` image tags. This works in both PDF and DOCX.

### Page Breaks in Loops

Child loops repeat whatever content is between the opening and closing tags — **including page breaks**. This means you can put each child record on its own page just by adding a page break inside the loop.

**Example: One receipt per Opportunity**

Say you have an Account with multiple Opportunities and you want each Opportunity printed as a separate receipt page. In your Word template:

```
{#Opportunities}
                    RECEIPT
Customer:   {Account.Name}
Date:       {CloseDate:MM/dd/yyyy}
Amount:     {Amount:currency}
Rep:        {Owner.Name}

Thank you for your business!
                                        ← page break here
{/Opportunities}
```

Insert the page break in Word (Insert → Page Break, or Ctrl+Enter) right before the closing `{/Opportunities}` tag. Each Opportunity gets its own full page.

**How to set it up:**
1. Open your `.docx` template in Word
2. Place your opening loop tag (`{#Opportunities}`) at the top
3. Design one page of content using merge tags
4. At the bottom, insert a **Page Break** (Insert → Page Break)
5. Place the closing tag (`{/Opportunities}`) right after the page break
6. Upload the template — each child record gets its own page

This works with any child loop — Contacts, Line Items, Cases, custom objects. Anything you can loop over, you can page-break over. Combine it with images, barcodes, QR codes, and formatting tags to build invoices, packing slips, certificates, or anything that needs one page per record.

---

## Template Formats

| Format | Template | Output | Images | Barcodes/QR | Rich Text | Best For |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **Word** | `.docx` | PDF or DOCX | Yes | Yes (PDF) | Yes | Contracts, proposals, letters, invoices |
| **Excel** | `.xlsx` | XLSX | No | No | No | Data exports, reports, financial summaries |
| **PowerPoint** | `.pptx` | PPTX | No | No | No | Presentations, slide decks |

All formats support: field tags, parent lookups, child loops, aggregates, conditionals, date formatting, number/currency formatting.

**Word** is the most capable — it's the only format that supports images, barcodes, QR codes, rich text, and PDF output.

---

## PDF Merger

Five ways to combine PDFs, all running client-side in the browser:

| Mode | How It Works |
|------|-------------|
| **Generate & Merge** | Generate from a template, then append existing PDFs from the record |
| **Document Packets** | Select multiple templates, generate them all, merge into one PDF |
| **Merge Only** | Combine existing PDFs on the record with drag-and-drop ordering |
| **Child Record PDFs** | Pick a child relationship (e.g., Opportunities), filter, select PDFs from child records, merge |
| **Bulk Merge** | After bulk generation, merge all generated PDFs into one downloadable document |

Each PDF is fetched in its own Apex call (fresh 6 MB heap). The merge engine (`docGenPdfMerger.js`) handles the binary work — parsing object graphs, renumbering references, flattening page trees, writing cross-reference tables. No size limits on download. Save to record up to ~3 MB.

**Child Record PDFs** — From a parent record (e.g., Account), select a child relationship, optionally filter with a WHERE clause (e.g., `StageName = 'Closed Won' AND CloseDate = THIS_MONTH`), browse PDFs grouped by child record with Select All, and merge into one document.

**Bulk Merge** — After running bulk generation, each completed job shows a merge icon in the Recent Jobs list. Click it to download all generated PDFs merged into a single file. Name your jobs for easy searching later.

## How It Stays Under Salesforce Limits

| Technique | What It Does | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Pre-decomposition** | Templates unzipped on save; generation loads only XML, never the full ZIP | ~75% heap reduction |
| **Zero-heap images** | PDF images referenced by URL, not loaded into memory | Unlimited images |
| **Client-side assembly** | Browser builds DOCX/XLSX files; each image gets its own request | No size limit |
| **Client-side PDF merge** | PDFs fetched one at a time, merged in browser via pure JS engine | Unlimited merge |
| **Multi-level queries** | One SOQL per relationship depth, stitched in Apex | 3 levels = 3 queries |

---

## Automation

### Flow Actions

| Action | Inputs | Output |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `DocGenFlowAction` | templateId, recordId | contentDocumentId |
| `DocGenBulkFlowAction` | templateId, queryCondition | jobId |

Both work in Record-Triggered Flows, Screen Flows, and Subflows.

### Bulk Generation

Generate documents for hundreds of records at once. Enter a filter condition, click Submit. Real-time progress tracking via the Bulk Generate tab.

### Record Page Component

Drop `docGenRunner` onto any Lightning Record Page via App Builder. Full UI with template selection, output mode, PDF merging, and document packets.

---

## Limitations

| Limitation | Details | Workaround |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **PDF fonts** | Helvetica, Times, Courier, Arial Unicode MS only | Generate as DOCX for custom fonts |
| **PDF file size** | ~3 MB per individual PDF for merge/save | Download has no limit |
| **Barcodes/QR** | PDF output only | Not available in DOCX/XLSX/PPTX |
| **Images** | Word templates only | Place static images directly in Excel/PPTX |
| **Excel/PPTX output** | Native format only, no PDF conversion | Use Word template for PDF |
| **Heap (sync)** | 6 MB per transaction | Use DOCX output for large docs (client-side assembly) |
| **Heap (async)** | 12 MB per batch execute | Batch size 1 gives fresh heap per record |
| **No e-signatures** | Intentionally excluded | Use DocuSign, Adobe Sign, etc. after generation |

## Architecture

```
Template (.docx/.xlsx/.pptx)
    ↓
Decompress → Merge XML tags → Recompress
    ↓                              ↓
  DOCX/XLSX/PPTX              PDF path:
  (client-side ZIP)     DocGenHtmlRenderer → Blob.toPdf()
```

| Class | Role |
|-------|------|
| `DocGenService` | Core merge engine — tags, loops, images, aggregates, barcodes |
| `DocGenHtmlRenderer` | DOCX XML → HTML for PDF rendering, barcode/QR CSS |
| `DocGenDataRetriever` | Multi-level SOQL with query tree stitching |
| `BarcodeGenerator` | Code 128 + QR code generation (pure Apex, Reed-Solomon) |
| `DocGenController` | LWC controller — template CRUD, generation endpoints |
| `DocGenBatch` | Batch Apex for bulk document generation |
| `DocGenGiantQueryBatch` | Cursor-paginated harvest for 2,000+ child records |
| `DocGenGiantQueryAssembler` | Progressive Queueable chain — accumulates HTML, renders PDF |
| `docGenPdfMerger.js` | Client-side PDF merge engine (pure JS) |
| `docGenZipWriter.js` | Client-side Office Open XML assembly (pure JS) |
