## Why This Exists

Document generation in Salesforce is expensive. The market leaders charge per-user, per-month fees that quickly add up across an organization. We believe basic document needs should be accessible to everyone.

This project gives you a professional-grade document engine -- template management, bulk generation, flow integration, server-side PDF rendering, and image injection -- entirely for free and fully open-source.

## Quick Install

**Package Version ID**: `04tdL000000RhvJQAS`

**CLI:**
```bash
sf package install --package 04tdL000000RhvJQAS --wait 10 --installation-key-bypass
```

**Browser:**
- [Install in Production](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tdL000000RhvJQAS)
- [Install in Sandbox](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tdL000000RhvJQAS)

> Select **Install for Admins Only** during installation, then assign permission sets to your users.

> **Required after install:** You must enable the Spring '26 Release Update **"Use the Visualforce PDF Rendering Service for Blob.toPdf() Invocations"** for PDF generation to work correctly. Without it, PDFs will render raw CSS as visible text and images will not appear. Go to [Setup > Release Updates](/lightning/setup/ReleaseUpdates/home) and enable it. This is opt-in until Summer '26 when Salesforce enforces it for all orgs. See [Required: Enable Updated Blob.toPdf()](#required-enable-updated-blobtopdf-spring-26) for full details.

## Known Limitations

DocGen runs 100% on the Salesforce platform, which means it operates within [Apex Governor Limits](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_gov_limits.htm). Here's what that means in practice:

| Limit | Value | What It Means |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Heap size (synchronous)** | 6 MB | The maximum memory available for a single document generation from a record page or Flow. This includes the template file, merged data, images, and the output document — all held in memory at once. |
| **Heap size (asynchronous)** | 12 MB | The limit for bulk generation jobs, which run as Batch Apex. Each record gets its own 12 MB transaction. |
| **SOQL queries** | 100 per transaction | Each document generation uses queries to fetch the record, parent fields, and child lists. The [Query Builder](#getting-started) limits parent fields to **10** and child relationships to **5** to keep well within this budget. |
| **SOQL subqueries** | 20 per transaction | Salesforce limits the number of child relationship subqueries in a single SOQL statement. The Query Builder's 5-relationship cap provides a safe margin. |
| **Total query rows** | 50,000 per transaction | All records returned across all queries count toward this limit. Child loops with thousands of records (e.g., 500 line items per Opportunity) can approach this. |

**Large Documents & Images** — Because PDF rendering and image injection happen server-side, memory usage climbs with each image. If your documents include multiple images, use optimized/low-resolution versions to avoid `LimitException: Apex heap size too large`.

**Is this right for you?** — If your use case consistently requires documents or image data larger than these limits, this tool may not be the right fit in its current state. For very large documents, consider the [client-side generation option](https://github.com/DaveMoudy/SalesforceDocGen/issues/23) which offloads assembly to the browser.

## What's New in v1.4.0

### Font Support

**PDF output** uses Salesforce's built-in PDF rendering engine, which supports these fonts: **Helvetica** (sans-serif), **Times** (serif), **Courier** (monospace), and **Arial Unicode MS** (CJK/multibyte). Custom fonts cannot be loaded into the engine — this is a Salesforce platform limitation (`Blob.toPdf()` does not support CSS `@font-face`).

**DOCX output** preserves whatever fonts are in your template. If you need custom fonts (branded typefaces, barcode fonts, decorative scripts), **generate as DOCX** — the fonts carry through from the template file and render correctly when opened in Word or any compatible viewer.

### Signature Feature Removed

E-signature functionality has been **intentionally removed** from DocGen. Electronic signatures carry jurisdiction-specific legal requirements (ESIGN Act, eIDAS, etc.) that a document generation tool should not attempt to implement. Dedicated e-signature providers (DocuSign, Adobe Sign, etc.) carry their own legal compliance certifications -- we don't, and shipping a signature implementation exposes both the product and its users to legal risk.

DocGen focuses on what it does best: **generating documents**. For signature workflows, generate your document with DocGen and hand it off to a dedicated e-signature provider. The architecture supports clean integration points for this approach.

### DOCX Output: Download Only
- "Save to Record" option is now only available for PDF output
- DOCX generation uses client-side ZIP assembly which exceeds the Aura 4MB payload limit for save operations
- Download works for any size

---

## What's New in v1.3.4

### Performance: Zero-Heap PDF Image Rendering
- `{%ImageField}` tags pointing to ContentVersion IDs now skip blob loading entirely for PDF output — images are resolved by URL at render time with **zero Apex heap cost**
- Enables PDFs with **unlimited images** (up to 30MB total image size / 60MB PDF output) without hitting governor limits
- All image URLs (template images, ContentVersion IDs, RTF images) now use relative Salesforce paths for `Blob.toPdf()` compatibility
- Stress tested: 15 unique 1.3MB images + 500 child records generated successfully in synchronous context

### Performance: Pre-Decomposed Template XML for PDF Generation
- Template XML parts are now extracted and saved as ContentVersions during version save
- PDF generation skips full ZIP decompression and loads only the pre-stored XML — **~75% heap reduction** for the template merge step
- Existing templates automatically fall back to the ZIP path until re-saved as a new version
- DOCX/PPTX output is unaffected (still uses full ZIP for reassembly)

### Bug Fix: PDF Images Broken in Single-Record Generation
- Template images in PDFs were rendering as broken placeholders since v1.2.0
- Root cause: `buildPdfImageMap()` was prepending the org domain to ContentVersion URLs, creating absolute URLs. `Blob.toPdf()` only resolves **relative** Salesforce paths (`/sfc/servlet.shepherd/version/download/...`)
- Fix: Use relative ContentVersion download URLs, matching the original design from commit `35ea7cb`

### Bug Fix: PDF Loses Space Between Bold Merge Fields (#34)
- A space between two adjacent bold merge fields (e.g., `{FirstName} {LastName}`) was being dropped in PDF output
- Root cause: `String.isBlank(" ")` returns `true` in Apex, so whitespace-only text runs were discarded
- Fix: Changed to `String.isEmpty()` which preserves space-only content

### Bug Fix: Character Encoding (#21)
- Fixed `&` characters rendering as `&amp;` in PDF output -- the HTML renderer was double-encoding XML entities from the DOCX source

### Documentation Overhaul
- **Release Update visibility** -- Added prominent callout immediately after Quick Install explaining the required Spring '26 Blob.toPdf() Release Update. This was the #1 source of confusion for new users (Issues #27, #21, #28)
- **In-app admin guide** -- Added Release Update warning to the Overview section with a direct link to [Setup > Release Updates](/lightning/setup/ReleaseUpdates/home)
- **Query Builder limits** -- Expanded from one-word reasons to full explanations of why each limit exists, what Salesforce enforces, and links to Salesforce Governor Limits documentation
- **Troubleshooting** -- Added "PDF shows raw CSS text" as the first troubleshooting entry, pointing users directly to the Release Update
- **Known Limitations** -- Replaced terse limit descriptions with a detailed table explaining heap size, SOQL queries, subqueries, and total query rows in practical terms

### Rich Text Field Documentation
- Corrected inaccurate "plain text only" language -- DocGen already preserves bold, italic, underline, paragraph structure, and embedded images from Rich Text Area fields in Word and PDF output
- Added new **Rich Text Fields** section to README and in-app Admin Guide documenting what is and isn't preserved

### Page Layouts
- Updated all 9 custom object page layouts from DevOrg-398
- Added Files related list to all DocGen page layouts

---

## What's New in v1.2.2

### Admin Guide
- New **Data Model** section with complete object reference tables and relationship diagram

### Page Layouts
- Added page layouts for all custom objects

---

## What's New in v1.2.0

### Unified PDF Generation (#27, #21)
- Single and bulk PDF generation now use the **exact same code path** -- no more divergent behavior between single-doc and batch modes
- Removed 6 redundant PDF methods from `DocGenController` and 5 from `DocGenService`, replaced with a single unified pipeline: `mergeTemplate()` → `buildPdfImageMap()` → `DocGenHtmlRenderer.convertToHtml()` → PDF engine
- Removed `DocGenPdfQueueable` -- no longer needed; PDF generation is synchronous with pre-committed template image URLs
- LWC polling logic removed from both `docGenRunner` and `docGenAdmin` -- PDF calls are now simple request/response

### Spring '26 Blob.toPdf() Compatibility
- Orgs with the Spring '26 Release Update enabled get native `Blob.toPdf()` rendering with image support -- no VF page needed
- Orgs without the Release Update automatically fall back to VF `renderAs="pdf"` (Flying Saucer) for templates with images
- Text-only templates always use `Blob.toPdf()` directly for speed

### Page Break Fix (#21)
- Added `page-break-inside: avoid` to `<p>` and `<li>` CSS rules -- paragraphs and list items no longer split across page boundaries

### Net Change
- **-766 lines** of duplicated PDF logic removed across 11 files

---

## What's New in v1.1.1

### Signature Fix (#28)
- Fixed single-signer signature flow failing with "Script-thrown exception"
- The VF page now uses an `isSignerToken` flag instead of signer count to route correctly -- works whether 1 or many signers are created through the multi-signer flow

### Enhanced PDF Renderer (#27)
- Users no longer need to add CSS to templates for proper PDF output
- `DocGenHtmlRenderer` now converts Word heading styles (H1-H6), Title, and Subtitle to proper HTML tags
- Added support for: line spacing, page breaks (`pageBreakBefore`, `w:br type="page"`), paragraph borders and shading, bullet and numbered lists, hanging indents, superscript/subscript, all caps/small caps, hyperlinks, tab characters, horizontal rules, letter spacing, and `keepNext`/`keepLines` page-break controls
- Tables now support: cell-specific borders, column span (`gridSpan`), custom cell padding (`tcMar`), header rows (`<th>`), and table alignment (center/right)
- Base CSS includes orphan/widow control and `page-break-inside: avoid` on table rows

### Merge Field Compatibility
- Templates now accept Salesforce-style `{!Field}` syntax in addition to `{Field}`
- Base object prefix is automatically stripped (e.g., `{!Contact.Name}` resolves the same as `{Name}` when running on Contact)

### Query Config Parser Fix
- The field parser now handles missing commas between fields and subqueries (e.g., `Account.Name (SELECT ...)` is auto-split correctly)

---

## What's New in v1.1.0

### In-App Admin Guide
- Comprehensive admin guide accessible as the **first tab** in the DocGen app
- Sections covering every feature: templates, merge tags, permissions, versioning, flow automation, and troubleshooting
- Documents the `{%ImageField:WxH}` image injection syntax with ContentVersion usage

### Template Version Preview
- Version preview modal redesigned to show the **query configuration** that was active at that time
- **Download** the exact template file from any version
- **Generate a sample document** using a previous version's template against your test record
- Active/inactive status badges on each version

### Email Branding & Copy
- Customizable **email subject line**, **footer text**, **logo**, and **brand color** for signature request emails
- All configurable from the DocGen Setup tab
- Support for merge fields in the subject: `{SignerName}`, `{DocumentTitle}`, `{SenderName}`

### Security Hardening
- All DML operations wrapped with `Security.stripInaccessible()` for CRUD/FLS enforcement
- SOQL filter sanitization strengthened with whitespace normalization
- Error messages genericized to prevent information disclosure
- Debug logging levels reduced to prevent sensitive data exposure
- Added explicit `WITH SYSTEM_MODE` to all system-context queries
- Passed Salesforce Code Analyzer with zero actionable high-severity findings

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed setup wizard email preview typo
- Fixed duplicate `rawPreviewJson` getter in query builder
- Removed unused JavaScript imports and duplicate class members

## Getting Started

### Permission Sets

After installing, assign these from **Setup > Permission Sets**:

| Permission Set | Who Gets It | What It Grants |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **DocGen Admin** | Admins, template managers | Full CRUD on all DocGen objects, setup wizard access, template sharing |
| **DocGen User** | End users | Generate documents, view templates (read-only) |

### Adding Components to Record Pages

**Document Generator** -- lets users generate documents from any record:
1. Navigate to a record page > Gear icon > **Edit Page**
2. Drag the **docGenRunner** component onto the layout
3. Save and activate

### Required: Enable Updated Blob.toPdf() (Spring '26)

**This Release Update is required for all PDF generation.** The old `Blob.toPdf()` engine does not understand `<style>` blocks or `<img>` tags in HTML — it renders them as literal visible text in your PDF. The updated engine uses the same Visualforce PDF rendering service (Flying Saucer) that powers `renderAs="pdf"`, giving you proper CSS, image, and font support.

**To enable:**
1. Go to [**Setup > Release Updates**](/lightning/setup/ReleaseUpdates/home)
2. Find **"Use the Visualforce PDF Rendering Service for Blob.toPdf() Invocations"**
3. Click **Get Started** > **Enable**

**What this does:**
- Upgrades `Blob.toPdf()` to use the same rendering engine as Visualforce `renderAs="pdf"`
- Enables CSS parsing (`<style>` tags), image rendering (`<img>` with Salesforce URLs), and custom font support
- Required for all PDF output — single-record and bulk

**Without this Release Update**, PDFs will contain raw CSS text instead of formatted content, and images will not render. This is the most common issue reported by new users.

> **Note:** This Release Update is opt-in until Summer '26 when Salesforce enforces it for all orgs.

## Template Authoring Guide

### How Merge Tags Work

DocGen uses **plain text replacement**. Each tag in your template is swapped with the corresponding field value. That's it.

**What this means:**
- Tags are replaced with **text values only** -- they won't insert images, charts, or media (use the `{%}` image tag for that)
- Tables don't dynamically expand -- use **loop tags** for repeating rows
- Formatting (bold, font, color) comes from your template, not the data -- the replaced text inherits the tag's formatting
- **Rich Text fields** preserve basic formatting in Word output (see [Rich Text Fields](#rich-text-fields) below)

### Tag Syntax Reference

| Tag | Purpose | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `{FieldName}` | Simple field merge | `{Name}`, `{Email}` |
| `{Parent.Field}` | Parent record lookup | `{Account.Name}`, `{Owner.Email}` |
| `{#ChildList}...{/ChildList}` | Loop over child records | `{#Contacts}{FirstName}{/Contacts}` |
| `{#BooleanField}...{/BooleanField}` | Conditional section | `{#IsActive}Active{/IsActive}` |
| `{Field:format}` | Date with format | `{CloseDate:MM/dd/yyyy}` |
| `{%ImageField}` | Image (default 4"x3") | `{%Company_Logo__c}` |
| `{%ImageField:WxH}` | Image with pixel size | `{%Photo__c:200x150}` |

### Working with Child Records

Loop tags repeat content for each child record. In tables, the entire row is duplicated:

| Product | Qty | Price |
|---------|-----|-------|
| `{#OpportunityLineItems}{Name}` | `{Quantity}` | `{TotalPrice}{/OpportunityLineItems}` |

Use the **relationship name** (not the object API name) as the loop tag. Configure child relationships and their fields in the Query Builder.

### Image Injection

Use `{%FieldName}` to dynamically insert images into Word documents. This is the one exception to the plain text rule.

```
{%Company_Logo__c}           -- Default size (4" x 3")
{%Photo__c:200x150}          -- 200px wide, 150px tall
{%Headshot__c:100x100}       -- 100px square
```

**Supported image sources** (what to store in the field):

| Source | Field Value | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **ContentVersion ID** (recommended) | 18-char ID starting with `068` | `068xx0000012345AAA` |
| **Rich Text HTML** | Rich Text Area with embedded image | Any RTA field with an image |
| **Base64 data URI** | `data:image/png;base64,...` | Data URI string |
| **Salesforce file URL** | `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/...` | Salesforce file URL |

> **Best practice:** Upload your image as a Salesforce File, copy the ContentVersion ID, and store it in a text field. Then use `{%MyField__c:200x60}` in your template.

> Image tags only work in **Word (.docx)** templates. External URLs cannot be fetched (no HTTP callouts).

### Rich Text Fields

When a merge tag references a Rich Text Area field, DocGen automatically detects the HTML content and preserves formatting in Word and PDF output. No special syntax is needed -- just use the standard `{FieldName}` tag.

**What's preserved (Word & PDF):**
- **Bold**, *italic*, and underline formatting
- Paragraph structure (line breaks, paragraph breaks)
- Images embedded in the rich text field (Salesforce-hosted URLs and data URIs)

**What's NOT preserved:**
- Font colors, font sizes, and font families
- Text alignment (center, right, justify)
- Bullet and numbered lists (rendered as plain text paragraphs)
- Tables within the rich text field
- Hyperlinks (the text appears, but the link is not clickable)

**PowerPoint:** Rich text is stripped to plain text in `.pptx` output. Only Word and PDF preserve formatting.

**Images in Rich Text:** If your rich text field contains an embedded image (inserted via the Salesforce Rich Text editor), the image is automatically extracted and embedded in the output document. Salesforce-hosted image URLs are resolved to absolute paths so they render in both DOCX and PDF.

> **Tip:** For simple text fields (Name, Email, etc.), formatting comes from the template -- the merged value inherits whatever font/style the tag had in your Word file. For Rich Text Area fields, the formatting comes from the data itself and overrides the tag's template styling.

### Date Formatting

Append a format string after a colon:

| Example | Output |
|---------|--------|
| `{CloseDate:MM/dd/yyyy}` | 03/18/2026 |
| `{CreatedDate:MMMM d, yyyy}` | March 18, 2026 |
| `{CreatedDate:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}` | 2026-03-18 14:30 |

### Conditional Sections

Show or hide content based on field values:

```
{#HasSpecialTerms}
SPECIAL TERMS: This agreement includes special provisions...
{/HasSpecialTerms}
```

Content appears only if the field is truthy (non-null, non-empty, non-false).

---

## Bulk Generation

1. Go to the **Bulk Generation** tab
2. Select a template
3. Enter a filter condition: `Industry = 'Technology'` or `StageName = 'Closed Won' AND CloseDate = THIS_YEAR`
4. Click **Count Records** to verify
5. Click **Generate** -- documents are saved as Files on each record
6. Monitor progress in the Recent Jobs section (auto-refreshes every 5s)

Save frequently used filters with **Save Query** for reuse.

---

## Flow Integration

**Generate Document (Single Record)** -- `DocGenFlowAction`:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `templateId` | Input | DocGen_Template__c record ID |
| `recordId` | Input | Source record ID |
| `contentDocumentId` | Output | Generated file ID |

**Generate Documents (Bulk)** -- `DocGenBulkFlowAction`:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `templateId` | Input | DocGen_Template__c record ID |
| `queryCondition` | Input | SOQL WHERE clause |
| `jobId` | Output | DocGen_Job__c record ID |

---

## Architecture

All document generation runs **100% server-side in Apex** -- no client-side JavaScript.

```
Template (.docx/.pptx)
    → Decompress ZIP (Salesforce Compression API)
    → Pre-process XML (merge split text runs, normalize tags)
    → Tag Processing:
        {Field}           → plain text substitution
        {#List}...{/List} → row/content duplication
        {#Bool}...{/Bool} → conditional rendering
        {%Image:WxH}      → DrawingML image injection
    → Recompress ZIP → DOCX/PPTX Blob
    → PDF path: DocGenHtmlRenderer → Blob.toPdf()
    → Save as ContentVersion on record
```

### Key Classes

| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| `DocGenService` | Core merge engine -- tag processing, image injection, ZIP assembly |
| `DocGenHtmlRenderer` | DOCX XML to HTML conversion for `Blob.toPdf()` |
| `DocGenController` | LWC controller -- template CRUD, generation, versioning |
| `DocGenDataRetriever` | Dynamic SOQL with Schema validation |
| `DocGenBatch` | Batch Apex for bulk generation |
